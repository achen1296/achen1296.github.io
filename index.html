    Hello! My name is Andrew Chen. Consider this website the fun half of my
    public online profile (not social media, because I don't use any to post
    about myself), a place to showcase my coding projects and a few other
    things. (The boring business side &#x2014; education, career, credentials,
    etc. &#x2014; can be found on
    <a href="//linkedin.com/in/andrew-chen1296">my LinkedIn page</a>.) If you
    think this website looks basic, that's because it is! I'm challenging myself
    to learn web development while creating it, and I have to start somewhere.
